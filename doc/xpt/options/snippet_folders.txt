						*g:xptemplate_snippet_folders*
								  {default:[]}
	NOTE:	Unless you really want XPTemplate to touch your 'runtimepath',
		do NOT use this. This setting changes 'runtimepath' and is
		less recommended to use than 'runtimepath'. As you may already
		know well about 'runtimepath' and 'ftplugin', it is better for
		you to organize snippet files yourself, with 'runtimepath'.

	A list to specify which other folders are used as snippet folders.
	For example: >
		let g:xptemplate_snippet_folders = [
			\ $HOME . '/my_snippets',
			\ '/all_user_snippets' ]
<	Thus the snippet file "$HOME/my_snippets/ftplugin/c/my.c.xpt.vim" can
	be loaded to C files.
	And "/all_user_snippets/ftplugins/html/all.html.xpt.vim" can be loaded
	to HTML files.
