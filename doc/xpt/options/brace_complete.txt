	If set to 1, bracket characters are automatically expanded to bracket
	pairs. For example typing "(" results in: >
		(  )
	          \______| cursor stops in mid of pairs of bracket
<	"(", "[", "{", "'" and '"' are affected by this setting.
	
	If set to string, only bracket or quote chars included in this setting
	will be mapped. For example: >
		let g:xptemplate_brace_complete = '([{'
<	With this setting, quotes are not mapped.
