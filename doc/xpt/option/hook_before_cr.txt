						 *g:xptemplate_hook_before_cr*
								  {default:''}
	Add additional action before default xptemplate action when <CR>
	pressed.

	By default, xptemplate override key mapping of <CR>(local to
	buffer)every time starting to applying a snippet. This might change
	user prefered <CR> behavior if user has his own key mapping of <CR>
	defined.
	This conf let user to fix issues like this.

	The following line in .vimrc appends "abc" every time <CR> pressed
	during applying snippet: >
		let g:xptemplate_hook_before_cr = 'abc'
<
	And this appends current time every time <CR> pressed: >
		fun! s:OutputDate()
		    return strftime('%c')
		endfunction
		inoremap <expr> <Plug>do_my_work <SID>OutputDate()
		let g:xptemplate_hook_before_cr = '<Plug>do_my_work'
<
	NOTE:
		|g:xptemplate_hook_before_cr| does not accept <SID>.

		And if you want to use <expr> mapping with
		|g:xptemplate_hook_before_cr| , you need a in-the-middle
		mapping like it does in the second example.
