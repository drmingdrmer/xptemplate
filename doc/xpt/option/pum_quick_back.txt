	With popup menu, pressing "<BS>" removes minimal chars to reveil
	more options.
	If this is set to 0, pressing "<BS>" removes only 1 char.

	For example, popup menu created with 3 options: >
		"foo", "fooba", "foobar"
<
	Typing "fooba" shrinks menu to: >
		fooba
		foobar
<	Now pressing "<BS>" will remove 2 chars: "ba", and leave "foo", the
	longest prefix that has 3 options.

	Pressing "<BS>" again will remove "foo".

	NOTE:	Very large list might hang VIM for seconds. In this case set
		this to 0 to get better performance.

		This feature depends on a prefix dictionary of all of the
		options.  The prefix dictionary will be created every time
		popup menu is called.
