						     *g:xptemplate_lib_filter*
								   {default:.}
Value:  unset:	do not filter, load any snippet found.
	string:	regular expression.
	list:	list of regular expression.

	If set, XPT loads only snippets(*.xpt.vim) from 'runtimepath' that
	matches it or one of its elements.

	NOTE:	This option tries to match actual path of a snippet file.
		Symbolic link would be resolved.

	NOTE:	Included snippet like "*/_common/common.xpt.vim" is essential
		for other snippet to work thus it won't be affected by this
		option.

	For example: >
		let g:xptemplate_lib_filter = [
			\ '/my_snippets\>',
			\ '/all_user_snippets/ftplugin/xml/' ]
<	The above setting tells XPT to ignore snippet supplied by XPT but to
	load only "*/my_snippets/ftplugin/*/*.xpt.vim", and use only "xml"
	snippets from "*/all_user_snippets/ftplugin/xml/*.xpt.vim".

	It would works the same as with: >
		let g:xptemplate_lib_filter = '/my_snippets\>\|/all_user_snippets/ftplugin/xml/'
<
